# Math Notebook

A Windows notebook for blind students doing maths with NVDA and MathCAT. Use the keyboard
to write notes and homework, enter equations, and explore graphs by sound. You can import
course PDFs and LaTeX files and export your work as Word or PDF.

Everything runs on your own computer. Nothing is sent anywhere, except one question to GitHub
when you check for a newer version (below), and, only if you install Tectonic for the optional
equation check, Tectonic's own one-time download of TeX packages. It is a personal project of
one student, made for one calculus course first; see "What is tested and what is not" before
relying on it.

## What is in this repository

| Folder | What it is | Who it is for |
|---|---|---|
| [`notebook/`](notebook/README.md) | **Math Notebook**, the main app: the editor, PDF and LaTeX import, graphs, Word and PDF export, teacher mode | Students and teachers |
| [`sound-lab/`](sound-lab/README.md) | **Sound Lab**: the graph sounds and graph maths on their own, to try and tune the sounds. The notebook uses its engine. | Trying sounds; developers |
| [`recognition-lab/`](recognition-lab/README.txt) | **Recognition Lab**: reads graphs from pictures and PDF pages. The notebook uses its PDF reading. | Developers |

The notebook needs the other two folders, so keep them together.

See the [0.7.6 changelog](notebook/CHANGELOG.md) for changes since 0.7.5.

## Download it (Windows)

**This is a beta.** The app is still being built and is updated often; things may change,
and some parts are not finished or fully tested (see "What is tested and what is not").
Help > Check for updates asks GitHub whether a newer version is out and offers its download
page; Settings > Writing can do this each time the app starts (off unless you turn it on).
Nothing is downloaded or installed by itself: a newer setup is run by you, installs over the
old one and keeps your settings.

The [Releases page](https://github.com/ahemyaz06/math-notebook/releases) offers an installer
and a portable zip for 64-bit Windows 10 and 11. Both read supported PDFs without the AI
add-on. Version 0.7.6 adds optional PDF equation checking with Tectonic and braille export
with BrailleBlaster. Install those tools separately if you need them.

- `Math-Notebook-Setup.exe` installs it: a Start menu shortcut, an uninstaller in
  Installed apps, and newer versions install over older ones and keep your settings. It
  installs for you only (no administrator needed) unless you choose all users.
- `Math-Notebook-portable.zip` needs no install: unzip it anywhere (even a USB stick) and run
  `Math Notebook.exe`. Its settings stay in a `data` folder beside it. `Read me first.txt`
  inside explains how to start and update it.

In either version, choose Help > Open the user guide for the full instructions.

The app is not code-signed, so Windows may warn before it runs the setup or the exe.
SmartScreen's "Windows protected your PC": choose "More info", then "Run anyway". An "Open
File - Security Warning" dialog ("The publisher could not be verified"): choose "Run".
`SHA256SUMS.txt` in each release lets you check that the files are the ones published.

## Running from this folder (Windows)

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 22.12 or newer) and [Python 3.12](https://www.python.org/).
2. Open a terminal in this folder and run:

   ```
   npm ci
   py -3.12 -m venv recognition-lab\.venv
   .\recognition-lab\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r recognition-lab\requirements.txt
   ```

3. Start the notebook: `notebook\Start Math Notebook.cmd`.
   - Sound Lab: `sound-lab\Start Sound Lab.cmd` (needs only Node.js).
   - Recognition Lab: `recognition-lab\Start Recognition Lab.cmd`.

To build both Windows packages after setting up the source, install [Inno Setup 7](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php)
and run `.\recognition-lab\.venv\Scripts\python.exe notebook\build_release.py`. The installer,
portable zip and SHA-256 checksums go into `dist`.

## First minutes in the notebook (with NVDA)

- The document is one edit field, as in Word: NVDA stays in focus mode. **Alt** opens the
  menus, **F1** lists every keyboard shortcut. In a dialog, F1 or its **Help** button explains it.
- Type maths as plain text, such as `(x^2 - 4)/(x - 2)`, and press **Ctrl+Shift+E** to make it
  an equation. **Ctrl+Shift+R** reads the current line with its maths spelled out.
- **Right arrow** into an equation shows it as its plain text: the arrows move one symbol at a
  time and you can type to change it. When you leave it, it is an equation again.
- Working line by line: **Enter** after an equation starts a new line. **Shift+Enter** (or
  **F11**) copies the equation above down, ready to change.
- Comments, as in programming: anything after `#` or `//` stays words beside the equation and
  never becomes maths: `y = x^2 # the parabola`.
- Intervals, as written in class: `y = sin x, [0, 2pi]`, `y = sin x on (0, pi]`,
  `y = x^2 for 0 < x < 1`. On an equation, **Ctrl+Shift+D** adds or changes its interval. Its
  graph is then only on that interval, with solid and open dots at the ends.
- **F7** checks spelling, as in Word, with the Windows spell checker; **Alt+F7** goes to the
  next misspelled word. Equations are not checked.
- **Ctrl+Shift+G** inserts a graph. On an equation, **Ctrl+G** graphs it. In graph mode:
  - **J** and **K** step along the curve; **Space** plays it;
  - **period** and **comma** jump between points of interest (zeros, peaks, holes, corners, dots);
  - **S** says the slope, **L** the limits from the left and the right, **D** adds a soft
    second note for the slope after each step;
  - **I** describes the graph; **Escape** goes back.
- Help > Sound guide plays every sound with what it means, and has a short quiz.
- File > Import PDF or Import LaTeX (.tex) opens course files. File > Export as Word gives
  real Word equations.

The full guide is [notebook/README.md](notebook/README.md).

## The optional AI add-on

The notebook can read maths from many LaTeX PDFs using the text already in the file.
The optional AI can read scanned pages or describe pictures. It can miss or misread details
and needs a graphics card with about 8 GB of memory.

From the main folder, run the first command to get the runner and one model. The second
command is optional and downloads another model (about 6.6 GB):

```
.\recognition-lab\.venv\Scripts\python.exe recognition-lab\download_vlm.py
.\recognition-lab\.venv\Scripts\python.exe recognition-lab\download_qwen35_9b.py
```

Choose Qwen3-VL-8B or, if you added it, Qwen3.5-9B in Settings > Reading PDFs.

## Checking equations with Tectonic (optional)

For supported PDF pages read without AI, the notebook can use
[Tectonic](https://tectonic-typesetting.github.io/) to draw the equations again and compare
them with the page. It can correct some misreadings. Review important equations against the
original PDF. Install Tectonic separately
([installation](https://tectonic-typesetting.github.io/book/latest/installation/); for Windows,
the zip from its [releases page](https://github.com/tectonic-typesetting/tectonic/releases))
and put `tectonic.exe` on your PATH or set the environment variable `TECTONIC` to its full path.
The switch is Settings > Reading PDFs, "Check each equation". Details are in the
[notebook's guide](notebook/README.md#converting-a-pdf).

## Braille

File > Export as braille (BRF) makes a braille ready file with
[BrailleBlaster](https://www.brailleblaster.org/) (free, from the American Printing House), which
has to be installed. Every equation goes to it as MathML; for Nemeth maths, choose UEB with
Nemeth in BrailleBlaster's Translation settings. The approach follows Owen Petronick's Braille Check.

## What is tested and what is not

- **Automatic tests** drive the real app with key presses and check what it does and says
  in its status line. They also check the maths conversions, graphs, Word equations, PDF
  reading, the portable copy and the installed copy. They cannot hear a screen reader.
- **Heard with NVDA** by the author: writing, equations in focus and browse mode, stepping
  through an equation, intervals, graph mode and its sounds.
- **Not yet heard with NVDA**: whether the word "comment" is said before a comment, the
  Spelling box (F7), the Interval box (Ctrl+Shift+D), the setup's own pages, and the newer
  graph sounds (the instrument, beep and game voices, and "clearer pitch").
- **Tried on one computer only**: Windows 11 with NVDA, MathCAT and Access8Math, US English.
  Other screen readers (JAWS, Narrator), other languages, and macOS or Linux have not been tried.
- **Course material**: the PDF reader was built and checked on one calculus course's LaTeX
  PDFs and a few textbooks. PDFs made other ways (Word, scans) are less sure, and an
  unusual layout can be read wrongly without a warning.
- **Checking equations with Tectonic** was tried with Tectonic 0.17.0 on one calculus course's
  LaTeX PDFs (868 equations: 863 matched as read, 1 corrected, 4 misreadings caught but not
  corrected) and on thousands of made-up calculus equations. Tectonic is not bundled; it is
  not useful for PDFs made with Word or scanned.
- **Braille** was tried with BrailleBlaster 3.2.5 (UEB and UEB with Nemeth); the automatic tests
  use a stand-in. Seven LaTeX files were read back from their braille by a program, which found
  the missing list numbers (now fixed). The braille has not been checked by a braille reader.
- The full list is in the guide's "Limits, and what is not tested".

## Privacy and safety

- The apps listen only on this computer (127.0.0.1) and refuse requests from other websites.
- The notebook filters imported documents and pasted text before adding them to the editor.
- The app goes online only to check for a newer version: when you choose Help > Check for
  updates, or at each start if you turned that on in Settings > Writing. It asks GitHub's public
  "latest release" address once; nothing about you or your documents is sent.
- If you install Tectonic for the equation check, Tectonic itself downloads the TeX packages it
  needs from its own servers the first time it typesets. Your documents are not sent; the
  equations are typeset on your computer.
- Spelling uses Windows' own spell checker on this computer; Add to dictionary adds the word
  to your Windows dictionary, which Word and Edge use too.
- Settings and read PDFs stay on this computer: in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\MathNotebook` (the installed
  copy, and running from this folder), or in the `data` folder beside the portable copy's exe. Your own file locations (model
  files, a PDF folder) can go in `local-paths.json` in this folder; git leaves that file out.
