MATH NOTEBOOK 0.7.9 BETA (portable)

A document editor for maths that works like Word and reads well with NVDA and MathCAT.
Nothing to install, and no AI: everything is done by exact rules on this computer.

START
Extract all files from the zip into a writable folder, then open "Math Notebook.exe".
The cursor is in an empty document. Help > User guide opens the full guide.
Press Alt for the menus (File, Edit, Insert, Format, Math, Tools, Help). Tables are in
Insert > Table, graphs in Math > Graph, teacher mode in Tools > Teacher, and Settings is in
Help (Ctrl+comma). F6 goes between the small toolbar and the document. F1 opens the keyboard
shortcuts page.

The folder can live anywhere (Desktop, a USB stick). Keep all of it together. Your
settings and the PDFs you import are kept in the "data" folder next to
Math Notebook.exe, so copying the folder copies them too.

THE KEYS ARE WORD'S
Ctrl+B, Ctrl+I, Ctrl+U      bold, italic, underline
Ctrl+Alt+1, 2, 3, 0         heading levels 1 to 3, normal text
Ctrl+Shift+L, Ctrl+Shift+7  bulleted list, numbered list (Tab and Shift+Tab: in and out a level)
Insert > Table              a table; Tab moves between cells, Tab in the last cell adds a row
Ctrl+Enter                  page break
Ctrl+F, F3, Ctrl+H          find, find again, replace
Ctrl+PageDown, Ctrl+PageUp  next and previous heading; Ctrl+Shift+H lists the headings
Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+Y              undo, redo (any change, equations included)
Ctrl+S, Ctrl+P              save, print
Ctrl+Shift+W                export as a Word document (equations are real Word equations)
File > Export > PDF        a tagged PDF

MATHS
Type maths as plain text, for example (x^2 - 4)/(x - 2), select it, and press
Ctrl+Shift+E: it becomes a real equation. Alt+= inserts an equation. Ctrl+E on an
equation edits it as plain text; Ctrl+L there switches to LaTeX.
Working line by line: Enter after an equation starts a new line. Shift+Enter (or F11)
copies the equation above down, ready to change.
Right arrow into an equation shows it as plain text: the arrows then move one symbol at a
time and you can type to change it; when you leave it, it is an equation again.
Comments: anything after # or // beside an equation stays words, never maths
(y = x^2 # the parabola). Intervals: y = sin x, [0, 2pi] or y = sin x on (0, pi]; on an
equation, Ctrl+Shift+D adds or changes its interval, and its graph is only there.
F7 checks spelling as in Word (the Windows spell checker); Alt+F7 goes to the next mistake.

THIS IS A BETA
Math Notebook is still being built and is updated often. Help > Check for updates asks
GitHub whether a newer version is out (Help > Settings > Writing can do it at each start; it is off
unless you turn it on). To update, close Math Notebook, extract the new zip into a new folder,
and copy the old "data" folder into it to keep your settings and imported PDFs.
Ctrl+T turns an equation back into plain text, Ctrl+L into LaTeX text; Ctrl+Shift+E makes
it an equation again. When the cursor comes to an equation it is said as plain text (in
focus mode NVDA reads only its start; NVDA+Space and MathCAT read it whole).
Ctrl+Shift+M converts between plain text, LaTeX and MathML (both ways), with a preview
you can read with MathCAT. Ctrl+Shift+R reads the current line with equations spelled out.

GRAPHS BY SOUND
Enter on a graph line opens graph mode. J and K step along the curve, Space plays it, period
and comma jump between points of interest, S says the slope, L the limits from the left and
the right, D adds a soft note for the slope after each step, I describes the graph, question
mark lists every key, Escape goes back. Help > Sound guide plays every sound with what it
means. Help > Settings > Graph sound chooses the sound: calm, instruments, beeps or game sounds.

LATEX FILES AND SHARING
File > Import LaTeX (.tex) reads a teacher's LaTeX source exactly, including pgfplots graphs,
which become graphs you explore by sound. To share, export to PDF or Word: anyone can open
them. An exported PDF carries the notebook inside it (a standard PDF attachment), so Math
Notebook opens it again exactly.

TEACHER MODE
Tools > Teacher > Teacher mode lets a TA or tutor hide lines, words, answers and parts of graphs
(even the formula: students hear the curve and find it), preview the student copy, and save
or export it. Hidden parts are taken out of the student's files, not just hidden.

PDFs
File > Import PDF (Ctrl+Shift+I). Course PDFs made with LaTeX are rebuilt from their own
characters: every equation as real maths, and graphs drawn by LaTeX are read exactly and
can be explored by sound (Enter on the graph line). Without AI, two things cannot be read:
pictures (their place is marked), and pages that are scans or whose maths is drawn as shapes
(the page says so). The full Math Notebook with its AI add-on can read those.

OPTIONAL TOOLS
Install Tectonic separately to compare supported PDF equations against the page.
Tectonic downloads TeX packages when first used. Install BrailleBlaster separately
for File > Export > Braille (BRF). The full user guide explains both tools.

NEEDS
64-bit Windows 10 or 11. You can export Word files without Microsoft Word.
Windows may show a warning because the executable is unsigned.
