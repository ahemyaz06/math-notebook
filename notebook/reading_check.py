"""Checking what the PDF reader read, by typesetting it again (Tectonic).

LaTeX only goes from source to page, so the reader has to guess the source from where the
characters sit. Each guess can be checked: typeset the reading and look at it beside the page.
If every character is there, in the same order, raised or lowered by the same amount, and every
fraction bar and root covers the same characters, the reading is the page. Spacing is not
compared: a \\, before dx or a \\left( read as ( changes it and not the maths.

When an equation does not match, readings near it are tried (an exponent read as a subscript,
a root or fraction that reaches one character more or less, a root's index) and one is kept
only if it matches the page exactly. Nothing is guessed: what does not match stays as read.

Tectonic is found at TECTONIC, tools/tectonic/tectonic.exe next to the notebook folder, or on
the PATH; without it nothing is checked. Its first run downloads the TeX packages it needs.
